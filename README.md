11. When the pressure drops on its own, open the lid of the pressure cooker. If the gravy appears thin, then simmer till it reaches the desired consistency. The consistency is medium and neither thick nor thin. If the gravy appears thick, then add some water and simmer. For a slight sweet taste, you can also add up to ½ tsp of sugar.

Add the paneer cubes (250 to 300 grams). Simmer on a low flame for 1 minute or till the paneer cubes are cooked. Avoid overcooking as then the paneer would become dense and rubbery. You can even shallow or pan fry the paneer pieces separately and then add these to the curry.
